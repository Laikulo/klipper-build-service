<h3>FAQs</h3>
<pre>
Q: Why is this page unstyled, and most of the projects don't have links?
A: Identifying licenses for these projects was far more of a pain than I expected, so I couldn't be bothered.

Q: I'd like the source code of something in KBS that isn't already published or downloadable, how do I get that?
A: Please send an email to kbs-license@haun.guru. Everything should already be up there, or on the github, but I might
   have missed something.

Q: Hey, that's my project, and you've got the license listed wrong, or a link is broken. How can we fix this?
A: That's an oversight in my part, email kbs-license@haun.guru, and we'll sort it out.

Q: Why is this like this?
A: Apparently, licenses are complicated, and there are a ton of similar ones, and many don't identify which they are.

Q: Can I have an SBOM?
A: For now, no. I might work one up when I have the brainpower.

Q: Why go through this trouble, when this is an online service?
A: Some components of KBS run in your browser, and I consider that distribution in binary (wasm) and some source (js).

Q: Do you feel that you have complied with the licenses of the projects KBS uses or is based on?
A: Before I wrote this page, I thought I was pretty much safe.
   Having looked deeper, I can say I am not at all qualified to answer that question.
   Though I am pretty sure that I am compliant, at least as much as a layperson like myself ever can be.
